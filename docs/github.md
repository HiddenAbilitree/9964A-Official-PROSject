# GitHub

Due to the fact that our team utilized PROS and has multiple developers, the implementation of a version control system was imperative. This is what led us to use GitHub, arguably the most universally recognized method of version control used by developers across the world.

Our team utilized GitHub in order to allow multiple people to work on the program, as well as to host this website that you are reading from right now.

We used two branches, one for the main program and one to build the website on. We utilized GitHub actions in order to build our website on each commit, allowing for us to change the website easily.

This website was built using the Material for MkDocs theme, one of the many themes used for program documentation.
